# CIMS-Exp1

Supporting code for experiment 1: siamese CNN on toy dataset (CIFAR-10)

To construct the dataset I used the .png format mirror[1] of the original cifar 10 dataset[2]. Image pairs were sampled at random, joined horizontally and labelled accordingly.

I used darknet[1] for the experiment, and roughly followed the setup described in the CIFAR-10 tutorial[4].

See my blogpost for further information[5].
